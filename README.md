# Coursera "Single Page Web Applications with AngularJS" 
On week 1, I got acquainted with MVC pattern in Angular.js, thanks to Yaakov course on Coursera (from Johns Hopkins University). 
* I accomplished the **first assignment** of Coursera buy building a **<a href="https://anouchk.github.io/coursera_Check_Lunch/">Lunch checker</a>** using Angular.js. A nice way to see if I ate too much for Halloween !
